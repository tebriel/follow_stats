Follow Stats
============

App to calculate a "followability" score for a twitter user. Intended to tell you generally if
they're worth following. Weighted based on RTs, Tweets, and @'s.

Too high % of RTs to Tweets is undesireable.
High % of @'s to Tweets shows high user engagement.
High % plain tweets shows lack of engagement (just tweeting into a black hole).

Obviously I'm just mucking around here. Trying out some new things.
